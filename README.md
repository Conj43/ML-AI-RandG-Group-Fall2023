This is a group project I helped to work on in Fall 2023. We created a driving game using PyGame and used PyTorch to implement machine learning in the game by having the car learn how to 
drive around the track. We all were new to Machine Learning, and some of us were new to Python so it was a learning experience for all. I learned a lot about Q Learning and specifically Deep Q Learning.
